# Universal-Classification-Studio
üß† Universal Classification Studio
A single-file Streamlit application that turns any tabular CSV into a live, downloadable probability model in seconds.

What it does
Upload a CSV with numeric and/or categorical columns.

Pick the target (binary or multi-class).

Select an algorithm:

Logistic Regression

Gradient Boosting

Random Forest

Train ‚Äì the app handles preprocessing (impute ‚ñ∏ scale ‚ñ∏ one-hot encode) and splits data into train / test.

See accuracy + ROC-AUC, an interactive ROC curve (binary), and a table of scored rows.

Download the scored CSV and the champion model (model.pkl) for later use.

POC ONLY ‚Äì no hyper-parameter tuning, bias checks, or governance.
